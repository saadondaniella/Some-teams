<h2><?='Who is Daniella?'?></h2>

<p>I was born in 1988, and from the very beginning I was a bubbly, creative soul.
As a child, I was always smiling, spreading joy everywhere I went.
A fun fact? I couldn’t pronounce the letter S until I was five — so instead I filled the air 
with lots of ttttttts!<br><br>

I grew up with an older sister, just two years ahead of me. We were inseparable best friends
as kids, until school came along
and suddenly our worlds were full of classmates and adventures.<br><br>

Games, sports, and travel have always been a huge part of my life. I honestly can’t count 
the endless hours I spent glued to my beloved Game Boy. Beyond gaming, I tried just about 
every sport you can think of — football, horse riding, gymnastics competitions, taekwondo, bowling, dance, 
training, badminton… you name it, I probably gave it a go.
To me, joy comes from being active, outdoors, and sharing experiences with the people 
I care about. Whether it’s sports, travel, or simply doing something fun together, that 
has always been a big part of what gives life meaning.
That same energy and curiosity carried into my career. <br><br>

I began my professional journey in retail, eventually becoming a store manager at NK in Gothenburg,
 where creativity and leadership walked hand in hand.
 But at one point, I felt the need for something new. Taking the leap into Visual Merchandising was 
 the beginning of a turning point — it opened up new ways of thinking about creativity, design, and 
 communication.
And that step eventually led me here — to my current adventure at Yrgo, diving into the world of web 
development. For me, this is not just another chapter, but the start of a whole new journey: combining
 everything I’ve learned about creativity and visual storytelling with the skills to actually build 
 and shape digital experiences.<br><br>

This is me — a mix of energy, imagination, and a lifelong passion for learning, creating, and sharing 
joy with others.<br><br>
See you guys on the web!<br>

Best regards<br>
Daniella Saadon / Future fullstack developer.</p>
